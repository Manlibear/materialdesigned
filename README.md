Material Designed
=============

A single-column Tumblr theme built to look like a web-app according to the Google's [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design) principles.

[materialdesigned.tumblr.com](http://materialdesigned.tumblr.com);

###INSTALL
You have two options:

1. Copy the [theme.html](theme/theme.html) file and paste it in the customisation area of your tumblog. `www.tumblr.com/customize/LINK`;
2. Install it via the [Theme Garden](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/39128) but this theme has not been accepted by the Tumblr Team yet.

###COMPONENTS:

* [Html5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv]);

The [Grid-A-Licious](https://github.com/suprb/Grid-A-Licious) plugin was modified by me [see the repository I forked](https://github.com/dcdeiv/Grid-A-Licious). This component is added as a submodule.

The other components are installed via Bower. `bower install html5shiv simple-sidebar`. See [`.bowerrc`](.bowerrc) file.
